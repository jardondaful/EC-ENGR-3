# TI-RSLK-Robotic-Car-Path-Follower

The code in written by David Bughman and Jordan Lin

This is a program that allows the TI-RSLK robotic car to follow a black line over a track. Once the car sees a horizontal line at the end of the track, it completes a 180 degree turn then follows the track again until it ends back up at the beginning.
To keep the car on the line, PD control is used.
